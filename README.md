# Convolutional Neural Networks
This section  we explore different libraries to solve different image processing problems using convolutional neural networks

## Data
After downloading the datasets, they should be placed in a folder called **data** in order for the code to work.


The Street View House Numbers (**SVHN**) data can be found [here](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).

The Facial Expression Recognition (**FER**) data can be found [here](www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge).

## SVHN
* Theano
* Tensorflow (tf.nn)
* Tensorflow (tf.layers)

## FER
* Tensorflow (tf.nn)
* Tensorflow (tf.layers)
* Keras
